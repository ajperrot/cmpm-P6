selection:
Our two selection functions are as follows:
 truncation selection:
  this we did by taking the top 1/p best fit members of the population,
  and randomly breeding them with one another to produce p children each
  we used the wikipedia article on this for reference:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_selection
 roulette wheel selection:
  this was accomplished by generating a sum of all _fitness values in the population,
  choosing a random number between zero and that,
  and then subtracting each individual's _fitness from that until it dips below zero.
  This method gives each individual a chance to be selected
  relative to its _fitness reletive to the group's overall _fitness.
  The algorithm was once again derived from wikipedia:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection#Java_â€“_linear_O(n)_version
